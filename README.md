# 🛒 Shopping Cart Project (JavaScript)

This is a simple shopping cart project built with Vanilla JavaScript.

Products are fetched from the FakeStore API and rendered on the page. Users can browse products, search between them, add items to the cart, increase or decrease quantities, and remove products from the cart.

The cart data is stored in LocalStorage, so items remain available after page refresh.

The main focus of this project was JavaScript logic and data flow, not advanced UI design.

CSS is kept simple and functional.

This project was built to practice working with APIs, state management, and DOM manipulation.
